# Project Memory - SagraFacile WebApp Frontend

# How to work on the project
*   **Technology:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui.
*   **API Interaction:** Use `src/services/apiClient.ts` for backend calls. Ensure DTOs in `src/types/index.ts` match backend definitions. Handle loading and error states gracefully.
*   **State Management:** Primarily React Context API (`src/contexts`) for global state like Auth, Organization, Session. Use hooks (`src/hooks`) for reusable logic (e.g., `useSignalRHub`, `usePrinterWebSocket`). Use `useState` for local component state.
*   **UI Components:** Leverage Shadcn/ui components (`src/components/ui`). Create reusable custom components in `src/components` following Shadcn patterns where applicable.
*   **Routing:** Use Next.js App Router conventions (`src/app`). Protect routes using layout checks (`src/app/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/app/org/[orgId]/layout.tsx`) and `AuthContext`.
*   **Real-time:** Use `useSignalRHub` hook for SignalR interactions with the backend `/api/orderHub`. Use `usePrinterWebSocket` for local printer communication via `ws://localhost:9101`.
*   **Testing:** Manual testing by the user is the primary method after implementation. Focus on testing core workflows (Cashier, Waiter, KDS, Admin) across different roles.
*   **Memory:** Update this `ProjectMemory.md` file at the end of each session, summarizing accomplishments, key decisions, identified issues, and agreed-upon next steps. Reference relevant file paths.

## (2025-06-25) - Implemented Frontend Printer Document Type Configuration
**Context:** Extended the Admin UI to allow configuration of the `DocumentType` for printers, enabling support for both ESC/POS and HTML/PDF templates. This involved updating type definitions and modifying the printer management form and list.
**Accomplishments:**
*   **Type Definitions:**
    *   Added `DocumentType` enum (`EscPos`, `HtmlPdf`) to `src/types/index.ts`.
    *   Updated `PrinterDto` and `PrinterUpsertDto` in `src/types/index.ts` to include the `documentType` property.
*   **Printer Form Dialog (`src/components/admin/PrinterFormDialog.tsx`):**
    *   Added a "Tipo Documento" (Document Type) dropdown field.
    *   Reordered fields to place "Tipo Documento" before "Tipo Connessione" for better logical flow.
    *   Implemented conditional logic: if "Tipo Documento" is set to "HTML/PDF", the "Tipo Connessione" is automatically set to "Windows (tramite Companion App)" and disabled, as HTML/PDF printing requires the Windows Companion App.
    *   Updated form schema, default values, and `onSubmit` logic to handle the new `documentType` field.
*   **Printer List Page (`src/app/app/org/[orgId]/admin/printers/page.tsx`):**
    *   Added a new column "Tipo Documento" to the printers table.
    *   Reordered columns to match the form's new logical order (ID, Nome, Tipo Documento, Tipo Connessione, Connessione, Modalit√† di Stampa, Abilitata, Azioni).
    *   Added a helper function `renderDocumentType` to display the enum value as a readable string.
**Key Decisions:**
*   Prioritized user experience by logically grouping related fields and enforcing dependencies (HTML/PDF implies Windows connection) directly in the UI.
*   Ensured consistency between the printer creation/edit form and the printer list display.
**Outcome:** The Admin UI now fully supports configuring the document type for printers, laying the groundwork for managing print templates.
**Next Steps:**
*   (Future Phase) Implement real-time alerts and notifications for print job failures.

## (2025-06-25) - Implemented Frontend Print Template Management
**Context:** Developed a new Admin UI page for managing print templates, including conditional form fields based on document type, and integrated it into the application's navigation.
**Accomplishments:**
*   **Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`):**
    *   Added `TemplateType` enum (`Receipt`, `Comanda`).
    *   Added `PrintTemplateDto` and `PrintTemplateUpsertDto` interfaces.
    *   Corrected `PrintTemplateUpsertDto` to be a type alias (`type PrintTemplateUpsertDto = Omit<PrintTemplateDto, 'id'>;`) to resolve linter warnings.
*   **Print Template Service (`src/services/printTemplateService.ts`):**
    *   Created a new service with CRUD operations for `PrintTemplate` entities (get all, get by ID, create, update, delete).
*   **Print Template Form Dialog (`src/components/admin/PrintTemplateFormDialog.tsx`):**
    *   Created a reusable dialog component for creating and editing print templates.
    *   Implemented conditional rendering of form fields:
        *   If `DocumentType` is `HtmlPdf`, displays a `Textarea` for `htmlContent`.
        *   If `DocumentType` is `EscPos`, displays `Textarea`s for `escPosHeader` and `escPosFooter`.
    *   Integrated `react-hook-form` and `zod` for form handling and validation.
    *   Used `useOrganization` context to get the current organization ID for API calls.
*   **Print Templates List Page (`src/app/app/org/[orgId]/admin/print-templates/page.tsx`):**
    *   Created the main admin page to display a paginated list of print templates.
    *   Utilized the existing `PaginatedTable` component for data display, sorting, and pagination.
    *   Implemented functions to render `TemplateType` and `DocumentType` enum values as readable strings.
    *   Integrated "Crea Template" button and "Modifica"/"Elimina" actions for each row.
    *   Ensured correct data fetching and state management for the table and dialog.
*   **Navigation & Dashboard Integration:**
    *   Updated `src/components/admin/AdminNavigation.tsx` to include a new link "Template di Stampa" in the sidebar.
    *   Updated `src/app/app/org/[orgId]/admin/page.tsx` (Admin Dashboard) to:
        *   Add a new card for "Template di Stampa".
        *   Rename "Configurazioni" card to "SagraPreOrdine".
        *   Rename "Menu" card to "Categorie Menu" and added a new card for "Voci di Menu".
        *   Add a "Dashboard Completa" button to the Analytics section, linking to the full analytics page.
**Key Decisions:**
*   Followed existing project patterns for component structure, API services, and UI/UX (e.g., `PaginatedTable`, `react-hook-form`, `zod`).
*   Prioritized conditional UI logic in the form to provide a tailored user experience for different template types.
*   Ensured consistent Italian localization for new UI elements.
**Outcome:** The SagraFacile web application now has a fully functional and integrated system for managing print templates, enhancing the flexibility of document generation.
**Next Steps:**
*   User to test the new print template management functionality end-to-end.

## (2025-06-23) - Enhanced Order Filtering and Optional Pagination (Frontend)
**Context:** Implemented frontend changes to support the backend's new optional pagination and status filtering for orders, specifically addressing a bug where the waiter page was not distinguishing between order statuses.
**Accomplishments:**
*   **Type Definitions:** Updated `src/types/index.ts` to reflect the changes in `OrderQueryParameters` (nullable `page`, `pageSize`, and added `statuses?: number[]`).
*   **Component Updates:**
    *   `src/components/cashier/ReprintOrderDialog.tsx`: Removed hardcoded `pageSize: 1000` and `page: 1` from the API call, relying on the backend's new optional pagination behavior to fetch all orders.
    *   `src/app/app/org/[orgId]/waiter/area/[areaId]/page.tsx`: Re-added the `statuses` parameter to the `apiClient.get` calls for fetching both "pending" (`OrderStatus.Paid`, `OrderStatus.PreOrder`) and "active" (`OrderStatus.Preparing`, `OrderStatus.ReadyForPickup`) orders, ensuring correct filtering and display in their respective tabs. Removed hardcoded `pageSize: 1000` and `page: 1`.
    *   `src/app/app/org/[orgId]/table-order/area/[areaId]/page.tsx`: Removed hardcoded `pageSize: 50` and changed `sortDirection: 'desc'` to `sortAscending: false` in the API call for fetching past orders, allowing the backend to return all items by default.
**Key Decisions:**
*   Aligned frontend API calls with the backend's new optional pagination and status filtering capabilities.
*   Ensured that components requiring full lists of orders (e.g., waiter, reprint dialog) now correctly leverage the optional pagination by omitting `page` and `pageSize`.
*   Fixed the waiter page bug by reintroducing status filtering.
**Outcome:** The frontend now correctly interacts with the updated order API, resolving previous data display issues and improving flexibility.

## (2025-06-23) - Refactored Orders Page with Reusable Paginated Table
**Context:** Refactored the admin "Storico Ordini" page to use a new reusable, paginated table component, enhancing performance and code reuse.
**Accomplishments:**
*   **Frontend (Next.js WebApp):**
    *   Created a generic, reusable `PaginatedTable.tsx` component in `src/components/common/`. This component handles table rendering, sorting, pagination controls, and a page size selector. It also persists page size settings to `localStorage`.
    *   Refactored `src/app/app/org/[orgId]/admin/print-jobs/page.tsx` to use the new `PaginatedTable` component, simplifying its code significantly.
    *   Refactored `src/app/app/org/[orgId]/admin/orders/page.tsx`:
        *   Replaced the old static `OrderTable.tsx` with the new `PaginatedTable.tsx`.
        *   Integrated the `AdminAreaSelector.tsx` component for area filtering.
        *   Added `src/services/orderService.ts` to fetch paginated order data.
        *   Updated `src/types/index.ts` with `OrderQueryParameters`.
    *   Deleted the now-redundant `OrderTable.tsx` component.
**Key Decisions:**
*   Abstracted table logic into a reusable `PaginatedTable` component to be used across different admin pages.
*   Implemented server-side pagination for the Orders API to handle potentially large datasets efficiently.
*   Leveraged `localStorage` in the `PaginatedTable` component to provide a better user experience by remembering page size preferences.
**Outcome:** The Orders and Print Jobs admin pages are now more performant and maintainable. The new `PaginatedTable` component can be easily reused for other data tables in the application.

## (2025-06-23) - Implemented Admin UI for Print Job Monitoring
**Context:** Implemented the Admin UI for monitoring print jobs, providing visibility into the resilient printing system's operations. This builds upon the previously implemented backend job queue and processing.
**Accomplishments:**
*   **Frontend (Next.js WebApp):**
    *   Updated `src/services/printerService.ts` to include `getPrintJobs` (for fetching paginated and sortable print jobs) and `retryPrintJob` (for manually retrying failed jobs) methods.
    *   Added `PrintJobStatus`, `PrintJobType`, `PrintJobDto`, `PrintJobQueryParameters`, and `PaginatedResult` TypeScript types to `src/types/index.ts` to match backend DTOs.
    *   Created the new Admin UI page `src/app/app/org/[orgId]/admin/print-jobs/page.tsx`. This page displays a table of print jobs with columns for ID, JobType, Status, CreatedAt, LastAttemptAt, RetryCount, ErrorMessage, OrderId, and PrinterName.
    *   Implemented client-side pagination and sorting for the print jobs table.
    *   Added a "Retry Manually" action for failed print jobs, which triggers the backend retry endpoint.
    *   Ensured date formatting uses vanilla JavaScript `Date` methods for consistency, aligning with existing project style.
    *   Added a link to "Monitoraggio Stampe" in `src/components/admin/AdminNavigation.tsx` for easy access from the sidebar.
    *   Added a new card for "Monitoraggio Stampe" to the main Admin Dashboard page (`src/app/app/org/[orgId]/admin/page.tsx`) for quick access.
*   **Backend (.NET API):** (Note: Backend changes were detailed in `SagraFacile.NET/ProjectMemory.md`)
    *   New API endpoints `/api/PrintJobs` (GET) and `/api/PrintJobs/{jobId}/retry` (POST) were created and secured.
    *   Supporting DTOs and `PrintJobService` were implemented.
**Key Decisions:**
*   Implemented server-side pagination and sorting for print jobs to optimize performance for large datasets.
*   Provided a manual retry mechanism for failed jobs, complementing the automatic retry logic in the `PrintJobProcessor`.
*   Used vanilla JavaScript for date formatting in the frontend as per user preference and existing project style.
*   Integrated the new page into the existing admin navigation and dashboard for easy access.
**Outcome:** The system now has a functional Admin UI for monitoring the status of print jobs, allowing administrators to track print operations and manually intervene if necessary.
**Next Steps:**
*   (Future Phase 2) Implement real-time alerts and notifications for print job failures.

## (2025-06-17) - Enhanced README.md with New Introduction and Screenshots
*   **Context:** The main project `README.md` needed a more user-friendly introduction, including what SagraFacile is, who it's for, and its main features, along with visual aids.
*   **Accomplishments:**
    *   **README.md (`README.md`):**
        *   Added a new introductory section titled "SagraFacile: Simplify Your Festival Management".
        *   Included subsections: "What is SagraFacile?", "Who is it For?", and "What Does it Do?".
        *   Embedded three screenshots: `images/pos-interface.png`, `images/kds-interface.png`, and `images/dashboard-screenshot.png` under a "Screenshots" H2 heading.
        *   Added a link to the project website: `[sagrafacile.it](https://sagrafacile.it)`.
        *   Reorganized the README to present this new introductory content before the more technical sections like "Project Goal" and "Architecture Overview".
*   **Outcome:** The `README.md` is now more welcoming and informative for new users and potential contributors, providing a clear overview of the project's purpose and capabilities, supplemented by visuals.


## (2025-06-16) - Fixed KDS Real-time Order Updates & UI Enhancements
*   **Context:** Addressed an issue where the KDS (Kitchen Display System) was not receiving real-time updates for new orders. Enhanced the KDS order card UI for better readability.
*   **Accomplishments:**
    *   **Backend (`SagraFacile.NET/SagraFacile.NET.API/Services/OrderService.cs`):**
        *   Ensured `SendOrderStatusUpdateAsync` is called in `CreateOrderAsync` after an order is successfully created and its transaction is committed. This guarantees that orders entering KDS-relevant states (e.g., `Preparing`) directly from cashier actions trigger a SignalR broadcast.
    *   **Frontend (`sagrafacile-webapp/src/app/app/org/[orgId]/area/[areaId]/kds/[kdsId]/page.tsx`):**
        *   **SignalR Group Subscription:** Implemented logic to invoke `connection.invoke("JoinAreaQueueGroup", areaId)` after a successful SignalR connection, ensuring the KDS client subscribes to messages for its specific area.
        *   **Corrected Event Listener:** Changed the SignalR event listener to `"ReceiveOrderStatusUpdate"` to match the event name broadcast by the backend.
        *   **Refined Event Handler:** Updated the `handleReceiveOrderStatusUpdate` function to correctly process the `broadcastDto`, check `broadcastDto.areaId` for relevance, and `broadcastDto.newStatus` (especially `"Preparing"`) to trigger `fetchOrders()`.
        *   **UI Enhancement:** Modified the KDS order card to display the `displayOrderNumber` (or a fallback to `orderId` substring) more prominently (larger font, bold). The table number is now also displayed with a larger font and is conditionally rendered only if available. Customer name and order time are slightly de-emphasized for better visual hierarchy.
*   **Outcome:** KDS stations should now reliably receive real-time updates for new and updated orders. The KDS order card UI is clearer and prioritizes key information.

    *   Added a link to "Monitoraggio Stampe" in `src/components/admin/AdminNavigation.tsx` for easy access from the sidebar.
    *   Added a new card for "Monitoraggio Stampe" to the main Admin Dashboard page (`src/app/app/org/[orgId]/admin/page.tsx`) for quick access.
*   **Backend (.NET API):** (Note: Backend changes were detailed in `SagraFacile.NET/ProjectMemory.md`)
    *   New API endpoints `/api/PrintJobs` (GET) and `/api/PrintJobs/{jobId}/retry` (POST) were created and secured.
    *   Supporting DTOs and `PrintJobService` were implemented.
**Key Decisions:**
*   Implemented server-side pagination and sorting for print jobs to optimize performance for large datasets.
*   Provided a manual retry mechanism for failed jobs, complementing the automatic retry logic in the `PrintJobProcessor`.
*   Used vanilla JavaScript for date formatting in the frontend as per user preference and existing project style.
*   Integrated the new page into the existing admin navigation and dashboard for easy access.
**Outcome:** The system now has a functional Admin UI for monitoring the status of print jobs, allowing administrators to track print operations and manually intervene if necessary.
**Next Steps:**
*   (Future Phase 2) Implement real-time alerts and notifications for print job failures.

## (Next Session) - Planned Work
Current session paused debugging of USB thermal printer due to `SagraFacile.WindowsPrinterService` companion app registration issues. Next steps: Enhance companion app UI/UX for connection status and settings, improve logging. Then, resume USB thermal printer debugging, focusing on correct registration with `OrderHub` and print job dispatch/receipt verification.

# Historical Sessions (Condensed)

## Stock Management - Admin UI (Frontend - 2025-06-04)
*   **Summary:** Implemented Admin UI for stock (`scorta`) management. Updated `MenuItemDto` and created `StockUpdateBroadcastDto` in types. Added API client functions for stock operations. Refactored Admin Menu Items page: removed category dropdown (shows all items for area), added "Category" column, updated Add/Edit dialogs with category select and `scorta` input. Added "Stock" column, "Reset Stock" button (item-level), and "Reset All Area Stock" button (area-level) to the items table. Integrated SignalR for real-time stock updates in Cashier UI (display, out-of-stock indication, client-side pre-check).
*   **Outcome:** Admin users can now manage stock levels. Cashier UI reflects stock in real-time.

## DisplayOrderNumber Fixes (Frontend - 2025-06-04)
*   **Summary:** Corrected `displayOrderNumber` usage in Staff Pickup Confirmation page (table, SignalR, toasts), Waiter Interface (order view/list), and Cashier Reprint Dialog. Confirmed KDS components already had correct logic, pointing to a potential backend DTO issue for KDS.
*   **Outcome:** Improved display of human-readable order numbers across various interfaces. Backend KDS DTO check identified as a next step.

## Login Page Image Update (Frontend - 2025-06-04)
*   **Summary:** Changed the login page image to `/sagrafacile-logo.png` and adjusted styling for better presentation.
*   **Outcome:** Enhanced visual appeal of the login page.

## Display Order Number - Initial Implementation (Frontend - 2025-06-03)
*   **Summary:** Began frontend implementation for `displayOrderNumber`. Updated `OrderDto`, `KdsOrderDto`, `OrderStatusBroadcastDto` types. Modified Receipt Dialog, KDS main view & detail dialog, Public Order Pickup Display, and Admin Orders table to show `displayOrderNumber` (with fallbacks). Added an informational tooltip on Admin Areas page about `Area.Slug`'s influence on the order number prefix.
*   **Outcome:** Initial display of `displayOrderNumber` across multiple frontend views. Further testing and UI considerations planned.

## Automatic Token Refresh (Frontend - 2025-05-29)
*   **Summary:** Implemented automatic JWT token refresh. Added `TokenResponseDto` and `RefreshTokenRequestDto` types. Enhanced `AuthContext` to store/manage both access and refresh tokens in `localStorage` and state. Refactored `apiClient.ts` with interceptors to handle 401 errors by attempting a token refresh using `/accounts/refresh-token` endpoint, updating tokens, and retrying the original request. Includes logic to queue requests during refresh.
*   **Key Decisions:** Standard refresh token flow. `AuthContext` for token management. `apiClient` for transparent refresh logic.
*   **Outcome:** Improved user session persistence by automatically refreshing expired access tokens.

## Public Order Pickup Display & Staff Confirmation (Frontend - 2025-05-29)
*   **Summary:** Implemented frontend for Public Order Pickup Display and Staff Confirmation. Added `OrderStatusBroadcastDto` type. Enhanced `apiClient` with `getPublicReadyForPickupOrders` and `confirmOrderPickup`. Created Public Pickup Display page (`/pickup-display/...`) with initial data fetch, SignalR (`ReceiveOrderStatusUpdate`), order display, and TTS via new `useAnnouncements` hook. Modified Staff Pickup Confirmation page (`/pickup-confirmation/...`) with "Rechime" button and `useAnnouncements`. Refactored `useAnnouncements` hook for versatility (added `speakRawText`). Modified Queue Display page (`/qdisplay/...`) to use `useAnnouncements`.
*   **Key Decisions:** `Area-${areaId}` SignalR group. Centralized announcements in `useAnnouncements`.
*   **Identified Issues:** Public Pickup Display not showing orders (API returning empty), traced to potential backend `DayId` filtering issue in `OrderService.GetOrdersByStatusAsync`.
*   **Outcome:** New public and staff interfaces for order pickup. Backend investigation for data fetching issue prioritized. The "Planned Public Order Pickup Display" session's items were incorporated.

## Customer Queue System - UI & Real-time (Frontend - "Previous Date" prior to 2025-05-29)
*   **Summary:** Integrated Customer Queue System UI into `CashierOrderPanel` (props for state/actions, conditional display, "NOW SERVING"/"NEXT", "Call Next", "Call Specific", "Ripeti Ultimo" buttons). Enhanced Cashier Page (`/cashier/.../page.tsx`) with state for queue, initial fetch, and SignalR integration (`useSignalRHub` for `Area-{areaId}` group, listeners for `QueueNumberCalled`, `QueueReset`, `QueueStateUpdated` to update local state). Action handlers call `queueService` and rely on SignalR for UI updates. Created Public Queue Display page (`/qdisplay/...`) with initial fetch, SignalR, audio, and TTS. Corrected SignalR DTOs/event names (PascalCase).
*   **Key Decisions:** Queue UI in `CashierOrderPanel`. SignalR for real-time updates. PascalCase event names. Explicit group joining.
*   **Identified Issues:** Resolved SignalR event name/group joining issues. Resolved `useEffect` dependency issue causing handler re-registration. Cashier `lastCalledNumber` display issue remained under investigation.
*   **Outcome:** Cashier and Public Display UIs for queue system with real-time updates. Debugging of Cashier UI display ongoing.
